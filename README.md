# Pitch Shifter

This python code is written for my Signals and Systems homework. I took the lesson in my 3rd year in ITU CE.

The code takes an input signal and increases it's pitch. It outputs signal the new signal to a wav file. An example input-output is provided with Laura Branigan's song Self Control.
